# # Inject Secrets into a Sandbox with a proxy Sidecar

# Code running in a [Sandbox](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox) often needs to call an
# external API that requires an API key. Rather than passing that key into the Sandbox,
# you can keep it in a separate, trusted container and let that container add it to
# outbound requests:

# ```
# Sandbox code  ->  proxy Sidecar  ->  api.anthropic.com
# (no API key)      (adds the key)
# ```

# The proxy runs as a [Sidecar](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox-sidecars): a sibling
# container that shares a private network with the Sandbox. That network is reachable only
# from inside the Sandbox, so the proxy is available to your Sandbox code and to nothing
# else, while the key itself stays in a Modal
# [Secret](https://modal.com/docs/guide/secrets) mounted on the Sidecar alone.

# We use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as the proxy and the Anthropic API as the
# upstream, but any proxy that can set request headers (nginx, Envoy, or something you
# write yourself) and any authenticated API will do.

# Sandbox Sidecars are in alpha and access is restricted to allowlisted workspaces.

# To run this example, create the Secret it reads the key from:

# ```
# modal secret create anthropic-secret ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# ```

# `/etc/hosts` on the shared bridge network.

# Anthropic API, filling in the real key from the Sidecar's own environment. It also
# drops any `Authorization` header that came from the Sandbox, so the proxy decides which
# key reaches the upstream.

# Sidecars can't build their Image lazily on startup, so we
